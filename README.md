# 🤖 ML Model Zoo: A Learning Repository

Welcome to the **ML Model Zoo** – a collection of machine learning models trained and tested on various datasets, curated and developed as part of a hands-on journey to learn, understand, and master applied machine learning.

This repository is **not about production-ready code**, but about **learning-by-doing**. Each folder represents a different mini-project with its own model, dataset, and experimentation approach.

---

## 🧠 What's Inside?

This repo currently contains **5 different ML models**, each inside its own folder, including all code for:

- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Model Training**
- **Testing & Evaluation**
- **Visualization (when applicable)**
- **Experimentation Notes**

---

> 📌 *Each folder contains its own README for model-specific details.*


## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

The goal of this repo is simple:
> **To build, break, analyze, and understand machine learning models through real-world datasets.**

Rather than focusing on perfect results, the focus is on:
- Clean code
- Reproducibility
- Learning from mistakes
- Understanding evaluation metrics
- Experimenting with different algorithms

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or Python scripts

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dipen-26/ML-Model-Zoo.git
    cd ml-model-zoo
    ```

2. Navigate to any folder:
    ```bash
    cd foldername/
    ```

3. Open the notebook or run the script to explore the model:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    python model.py
    ```

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

- Add more models like **KNN**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks**
- Include **streamlit dashboards** for selected models
- Upload interactive **visualizations** and **feature analysis**
